# Ireumeun Ako Charlene ðŸ§™ Here's a little bit about myself from scratch!

### Being half Korean and half Filipino, I took half of each greeting from each side of my ethnicity's mother tongue as inspiration.
```
In tagalog, ang pangalan ko, 
is how to say, "my name is".

In korean, nae i-reum-eun, 
is the casual way to say, "my name is".
```

## For my work in progress portfolio the acceptance criteria is as follows:
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's
 previous work.
WHEN I load their portfolio.
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, 
a recent photo or avatar, links to sections about them, 
their work, and how to contact them.
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation.
THEN The UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work.
THEN The UI scrolls to a section with titled images 
of the developer's applications.
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application.
THEN That application's image should be larger 
in size than the others.
WHEN I click on the images of the applications.
THEN I am taken to that deployed application.
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various 
screens and devices.
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that 
adapts to my viewport.
